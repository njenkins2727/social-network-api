## Description
This application is the backend product of a social-network. I used a NoSQL database, Mongoose, to have a more simple data structure. This provides a quicker, responsive and even a more scalable database. I also used it to display my new skills. The challenges I faced with this was the logic for addFriend function.  .

## Installation
- npm i 
- npm start

## Usage
Use insomnia to create requests 
- /api/users - `GET` to get users and `POST` to create users 
- /api/users/:userId - `GET` to get a single user, `PUT` to update a user, `DELETE` to delete a user
- /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendsId - `POST` to add friend, `DELETE` to delete a friend
